Here are some useful resources.


# [The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book][themlbook]

This book covers the basics of machine learning techniques in a compact format (just over a hundred pages). The book was written by Andriy Burkov and went through an open online review process where the draft of each chapter was available for free for anyone to comment on. The PDFs are still available, and almost match the book word for word, so are worth a look if you want to brush up on some of the fundamentals.

# [Tensorflow playground][tf-playground]

A useful tool to help understand the basic concept on a neural work. The user can tinker with a neural network and see how the output changes.

# [Google Colab][google-colab]

Google colab is free cloud computing for python that supports GPU computation and includes tensorflow by default.

# [Intro2ML][intro2ml]

A collection of juypter notebooks that serve as examples for beginners of using neural networks to tackle different problems. The neural networks are written in Keras. 

NOTE: This is very much still a work in progress and in the early stages of development. Any feedback/contributions are much appreciated.
